## Hi there 👋 I'm Edwin, currently a Junior at Northeastern University, majoring in Data Science and Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy. I'm always looking for projects to explore data analysis and computational techniques. On campus, I am co-president of the Men's Water Polo team, a member of The Ortelian Society, the Math club, and I enjoy playing Jazz piano. 

I've recently worked on [Stratify](https://github.com/AdesolaOdubiyi/cs3200-final-project), a unified investment analytics platform.
